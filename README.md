This project is performed as a requirement of Udacity Introduction to Self Driving Car Nanodegree which uses computer vision techniques to build a classifier for images of traffic lights using a dataset of traffic light images in which one of three lights is illuminated: red, yellow, or green.

The following are the steps followed:

Loading and visualizing the data. The first step in any classification task is to be familiar with your data; you'll need to load in the images of traffic lights and visualize them!

Pre-processing. The input images and output labels need to be standardized. This way, you can analyze all the input images using the same classification pipeline, and you know what output to expect when you eventually classify a new image.

Feature extraction. extract some features from each image that will help distinguish and eventually classify these images.

Classification and visualizing error. Using the features to classify any traffic light image. This function will take in an image and output a label. You'll also be given code to determine the accuracy of your classification model.

Evaluate the model.
